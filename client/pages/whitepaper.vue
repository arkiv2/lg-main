                  <b>Lazy Goat</b> is a unique NFT community that brings together different people around the crypto-space. The project aims to release 9776 special NFT art, 888 for private minting and 8888 for public sale, and form an
                  exclusive club with the Lazy Goat holders. As part of our first massive giveaway, we have five rare Lazy Goat NFTs that entitles its holders to win <b>2,000 USDT or 100,000 pesos</b> once they are minted. In addition, as the
                  first ever in the NFT art space, we have one ultra-rare Lazy Goat which entitles the holder to win <b>10,000 USDT or approximately 500,000 pesos</b>. Owning one of our special NFTs from the Lazy Goat collection, members can
                  get full access to the network, resources, and benefits coming from our partners in the club.

              <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
              <p class="text-justify">
                  Five friends who are based on different parts of the world from Australia, New Zealand, China, and the Philippines; with their undying love for crypto, aspired to create the space safer and approachable for individuals like
                  them who had undergone countless failures and miserable investments with cryptocurrency & NFTs.<br />
                  <br />
                  Talking about opportunities within the space, they helped one another by experiencing different NFT games and communities. This is what formed the idea of creating a community that would soon share the same passion for
                  learning, playing, and investing for financial literacy and success. Their goal was shared, and was simple; create a club where like-minded folk in the crypto-space could hang-out, learn, and make friends along the way.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Lazy Goat was the product of the drive these friends had for all of those who are like them, that it may give hope and inspire all those within and are to come to the space of cryptocurrency.

                  Lazy Goat is a club aspiring to be one that is well-respected and loved, with a goal to be the best. We want to create not just a community, but a family that is tight-knit and welcoming. We wish to emphasize the value of
                  collaboration and mutual growth for partners and members as we attain more influence in the crypto-space as a club that inspires most if not all.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The aim is to create a platform that genuinely strives to bring people in the space together and form a support network, from people starting out in cryptocurrency to those who have been in the space for many years. We
                  strive to uphold three key values:

                      <p class="text-justify">
                          1. Growth: give club members access to resources that will help them become more knowledgeable and equipped with cryptocurrency. <br />
                          <br />
                          2. Inclusivity: engage with different crypto and NFT communities and create opportunities for club members to expand networks within the club. <br />
                          <br />
                          3. Social Responsibility: to support and help communities outside the crypto-space.

                  In the club, everyone is equal. The ultimate goal of Lazy Goat is really to create a space for like-minded individuals to help and support each other to grow in the cryptospace. In the future, we see this becoming more than
                  a club, but strive to uphold the true definition of brotherhood/sisterhood between members.

              <h2>NFTs</h2>

              <p class="text-justify">
                  Lazy Goats are NFT art from The Lazy Goat which also serves as the access of the holders to our exclusive club called The Grass. They are specially-designed NFTs that are generated from numerous available traits to create one unique goat to own. There are 12 different parts that make up these traits including the Horn, Head, Eyewear, Eyes, Mouth, Goatee, Skins, Shirt, Earrings, Accessories, Badges, and Background. For all the available traits in circulation, 1% of those are considered to be the rarest of them all.

                  In addition, the first 888 Lazy Goat mints will contain badges showing that they were part of the first and original batch of mints. They will be categorised under three types (Gold, Silver, and Bronze) with the possibility
                  of generating the following badge types as shown below:

For the five rare LGs, the holders will receive a 2,000 USDT or 100,000 pesos reward while for the one ultra-rare LG, the holder will win a 10,000 USDT or 500,000 pesos reward.

              <h2>THE LORE</h2>
              <p>
                  G.O.A.T., the one above all, throughout history only one has conquered and acquired its name. The forging of a king took blood, sweat, and tears, and is known by all to be well deserved. Countless hours accompanied by
                  surpassing the limits of what was possible for dedication, passion, and work, was a requirement to be on top. Becoming the best was not only an achievement, it was an addiction, as for the goats, anything less than the best
                  means defeat.

                  We have a growing network of over 20+ partnerships which include Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs); franchise businesses, hotels, influencers, crypto experts, major guilds in NFT games, and other communities in
                  the crypto space. We actively promote these partnerships on our social media pages and in the club to create more business opportunities for our partners and in return, add more access and value to our club members.
